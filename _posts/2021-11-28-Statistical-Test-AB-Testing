### Project Objective
Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game. 
As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an in-app purchase. 
In this project, we will analyze the impact on player retention when the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to level 40. 

### Analytical Objective
Test hypothesis to analyze if moving the first gate from level 30 to 40 will increase retention rate and total number of game rounds played.

### Dataset Used
Mobile Games A/B Testing with Cookie Cats Project data downloaded from https://www.datacamp.com/projects/184

### Importing library and data
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd 
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import shapiro
import scipy.stats as stats

# Read data from csv into pandas dataframne
user_df=pd.read_csv("Project_Data.xls")

# Check dimension of data
user_df.shape

# Check data info
user_df.info()

# display first 5 rows of the data
user_df.head(5)
```
